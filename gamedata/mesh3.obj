# Texture coordinates
# The textures on the side of the cabinet look strange, but as near as I can
# figure that's because of OpenGL and not because there's anything wrong here.
# To test it yourself draw a big colorful "X" on the mesh's skin and see how
# the lines are distorted. It's probably because the cabinet side is such a
# big polygon. It'd probably render better if I broke it down to several quads/triangles.
