%% *REWARD missions
%%
%% Don't let the name fool you- these missions aren't rewards in themselves;
%% rather, they present an opportunity for the PC to earn a significant reward.
%% The reward missions are typically more difficult than regular missions.
%%
%% The MechaSource rewards require a MECHA_SOURCE_MISSION coupon. Also check to
%% make sure that the appropriate mecha source tag is present. Note that gaining
%% a mecha source may unlock additional missions and rewards.
%%
%% The mecha source missions are arranged by faction, in order of Faction ID.
