.: CURRENT SCENE
	The current scene will be inserted as this element.
	In the case of a quest, this selects the root scene.

A: ARTIFACT
	Select one of the artifacts from the adventure list.

C: CHARACTER

F: FACTION

G: Grab
	The element will be grabbed from the story into which this plot or scene content
	is being inserted. Using G will result in an error if the plot/content isn't being
	inserted into a story.

KEY: Key Element
	From an arena mission it selects the core campaign enemy faction.

M: METASCENE

N: NEW NPC
	A new, completely random NPC will be generated. The format for a NPC request is
	as follows:

		NPC  [Faction Element] [Hometown Element] [CharDesc commands]

	Note that [Faction Element] and [Hometown Element] may be 0. The faction element
	may either point to the faction itself, or to any gear that is a member of that
	faction.

P: PREFAB

Q: QUEST SCENE
	A brand new permanent scene to add to the adventure. This scene must have a
	metascene described in the subcoms of the quest fragment. Requesting this type
	of element from anything other than a quest could have disasterous results.

S: SCENE

**************************
***   PLACE  STRINGS   ***
**************************

The elements of plots, subplots, quests, and random scene content can be
positioned in the adventure by using place strings.

PLACE(n) <[~](Destination Slot) [(team name)] [team data]>

If the destination slot is preceded by a ~. the element will be placed in the same
scene as the destination rather than in the destination itself.

A subplot can assign a place string to an element it inherits.

If (Destination Slot) is "/", the element will be frozen in a special
holding zone and will need to be moved by the script.
