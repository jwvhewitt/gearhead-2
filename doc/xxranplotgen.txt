**************************************************
***   EXTRA  EXTRA  RANDOM  PLOT  GENERATION   ***
**************************************************

First there was random plot generation. Then there was extra-random plot generation.
So, what do I name the improved plot generator for GH2? Extra-extra-random plot
generation, of course.


The plot components are selected based on a context string provided by the governing
story. This string contains the xxran descriptors; a label telling the difficulcy level;
descriptions for the xxran palette; and the PC's job.

A label preceded by a ~ is optional. It will increase the chance of this component
being selected, but doesn't have to be present.

A label preceded by a - must not be present in the story context. If it is, this
component cannot be selected.

A group of labels surrounded by parenthesis and separated by |s is an or-block. One
of the individual labels must be present and it will increase the chance of this
component being selected.

If the label "COMMON" is included in the list, this component is more likely to
be selected.



**************************
***   STORY  CONTEXT   ***
**************************

The story context contains:
- The xxran descriptors
- Tags for the completed dramatic choices, preceded by ":"
- The current difficulty level
- The context for the elements
- Certain merit badges, preceded by C:

DIFFICULCY LEVEL: EXTREME, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, NEGLIGIBLE
  !Ex, !Hi, !Md, !Lo, !Ne


*************************
***   PLOT  REQUEST   ***
*************************

The plot label will be *CORE_[a], where [a] is the identifier for the
PC's dramatic choice. At the beginning of the game the choice will be INTRO.
This identifier should always be five characters long.


******************************
***   EPISODE  STRUCTURE   ***
******************************

An episode consists of a base plot, several attached subplots, and the stubs
for the dramatic choices.

The basic structure for the plots is:

    CORE        Exposition; sets up the next part.
      MEET      Complication; PC is offered a mission, or somesuch.
        MAIN    The main course, usually a mecha battle.
        GOAL    The episode is won, the dramatic choice pays off.
        FAIL    The episode is lost, the PC must try something else.

CORE is the base plot. It must request a MEET-type subplot. Likewise, the MEET
subplot must request a MAIN-type subplot and usually also a GOAL and a FAIL.


****************************
***   DRAMATIC  CHOICE   ***
****************************

At the end of an episode, the PC gets to make a dramatic choice. These choices
are built into the episode like subplots. They may request or grab elements
as needed.


*****************************
***   PERSONAL  HISTORY   ***
*****************************

Family type: Standard, Orphanage, Circle, etc
Community members: Parents, siblings, dependants (may be siblings or children),
 mentor, rival, twin/clone
- Each family member should get attitude set. Siblings are Jr/Sr, while
  parents can be affectionate, protective, or distant.
Family atmosphere: Warm, Cool, Despairing, etc
Affluence: Rich, Middle Class, Poor, Destitute
Personal Issues: Seek lost parent, Seek revenge/justice

A problematic family history is essentially a wager; a penalty to starting PCs,
but a benefit if it can be overcome. On the other hand a positive family may
cause problems later on; for instance, if your family starts out rich, at some
point in the future there will likely be a crisis.

Resolving the personal issues will result in a merit badge, and this may
open up new options in the core story.




*************************************
***   NON-XXRAN  PLOT  CONTEXTS   ***
*************************************

The core story will have the descriptors below. A non-core story can have its own
label defined in a context SAtt. This may be used to limit certain persona fragments
and random scene content to a particular story or plot.

This label must start with a "=", may be as long as you want (as long as it's unique),
and may have several sections divided by underscores. For instance, the label "=MIL_DEFAULT"
can be used by the MILitary story DEFAULT or any of its plots.


**************************
***   XXRAN  PALETTE   ***
**************************

Every story that uses the xxran commands should have a standard set of elements. This
is so components can share elements between them, and also so that components can be
selected quickly without doing full element searches. The standard palette entries are:

1. Enemy Character (E:)
2. Enemy Faction (F:)
3. Target Faction (P:)

7. Root location of current episode (L:)
8. Target Item (I:)

These labels are followed by "++" if the element exists, or "--" if the element doesn't.
In addition, the desig and context strings for each element are included. For instance,
the tag "P:cor" would indicate that the PC's faction (P:) is corporate. The tag F:AEGIS
would indicate that the enemy faction is Aegis Overlord.

In addition, the designation of the element's faction is included if appropriate.

If the element is an enemy of the PC, an "ENEMY" tag is included. If the element is
an ally of the PC, an "ALLY" tag is included.

If the element has the same faction as the PC, "PCFAC" is included.
If the element has no faction, "NOFAC" is included.

If the element is a NPC, the relationship is also included. This may be one of "FAMILY",
"LOVER", or "FRIEND". If the element is a lancemate and currently in the party, "LANCE" will
be included.

Also if the element is a NPC, the heroic/villainous trait will be included as "GOOD_" or
"EVIL_".

If the element is a scene, its terrain SAtt will also be included: "SPACE", "WATER", "GROUND"

The job group of the PC is included as C:<job>. The available job designations are:
%%   ACADE: Academic
%%   ADVEN: Adventurer
%%   CORPO: Merchant, Corporate, White Collar
%%   CRAFT: Craftsman
%%   FAITH: Monk, Priest, etc
%%   LABOR: Skilled or unskilled labor
%%   MEDIA: Media, Performance, etc
%%   MEDIC: Medical
%%   MILIT: Military
%%   POLIT: Politician
%%   POLIC: Police
%%   THIEF: Criminal
See series\CG_JOBS_* for a complete and up-to-date list.

A lancemate will have a :TRAIN tag if they are currently eligible for the
TrainNPC command.

***   PLOT  DESCRIPTORS  ***
****************************

The first two characters of a plot descriptor are its type. Only one label
of a given type may be used in a single description. If a second label of
the same type is added, the original label is deleted.

In plot description, optional traits ("the flavor elements") are preceded
by a ~. These are not nessecary but will increase the likelihood of this
component being selected if they're present.

The story is made up of episodes. Each episode takes place in a single city.
Each episode is made up of several components.
